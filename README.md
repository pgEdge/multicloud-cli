A CLI to Rule the Multi-cloud


## Guiding Principles

  - follow [apache-libcloud](https://libcloud.apache.org) sdk as 
    much as reasonable

  - use agnostic and consistent field naming across providers such 
     as metro & location instead of region & availability_zone 

  - pure python and KISS

  - start with `compute` support for `ec2` & `equinixmetal`


## What's next

- `cluster` definition json file for grouping multi-cloud nodes

- support for `openstack`, `gcp` and `azure`
